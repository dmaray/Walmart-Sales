## Description:
Project from the Introduction to Linear Regression Regression Analysis Course (AMS 317) at Stony Brook Univerisity. In this project, Linear Regression was applied to analyze various factors that would impact the sales for Walmart. To reduce variability in the data, we focused on one location. Methods included formulating and testing hypotheses, checking statistical assumptions, and refining models to ensure accuracy and interpretability. We utilized R for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Then, we presented our findings through clear, data-driven reports, and visualizations (via Google Slides/PowerPoint).
