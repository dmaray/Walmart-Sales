# Walmart-Sales

Project from a Linear Regression Course (AMS 317). Four undergraduates performed a comprehensive linear regression analysis using Walmartâ€™s dataset. This involved formulating and testing hypotheses, checking statistical assumptions, and refining models to ensure accuracy and interpretability. We utilized R for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Then, we presented our findings through clear, data-driven reports and visualizations.
